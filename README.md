# Image Classifier with GUI

This repository contains a Python application that uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify images. The application provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) where users can select an image from their file system and receive a prediction about the content of the image.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The application includes a GUI built using `taipy` library, making it easy for users to interact with the image classification model.
- **Pre-trained Model:** The application utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, capable of classifying images into one of ten classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck.
- **Real-time Prediction:** Users can select an image from their local file system, and the application provides a real-time prediction of the content of the image.

## Requirements

To run this application, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `taipy` library
- `tensorflow` library
- `PIL` library
- `numpy` library

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install taipy tensorflow pillow numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanaagyei/ml-gui-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the Repository:

```bash
cd ml-gui-app
```

3. Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

4. Run the Application:

```bash
python classifier.py
```

5. Interact with the GUI: One the application is running, your web browser automatically opens at `http://localhost:8000`. Follow the instructions to select an image from your file system to view the prediction.
